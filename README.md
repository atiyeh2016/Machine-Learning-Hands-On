# Machine Learning Hands On

**Linear regression**  
  &emsp;Parametric learning models:  
      &emsp;&emsp;Define models and their parameters: what methods should be used to learn the hyperparameters  
      &emsp;&emsp;Closed solution  
      &emsp;&emsp;Numerical methods  
   &emsp;Higher degrees regressions using polynomial kernels  
   &emsp;A method for understanding the complexity of the model  
   &emsp;bias-variance tradeoff  
  
 **Logistic Regression**  
   &emsp;The logistic regression model  
   &emsp;Is it a classifier?  
   &emsp;Linear Regression Vs Logistic Regression
